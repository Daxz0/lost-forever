## Denizen Setup

* The `native` folder includes scripts specifically for Lost Forever. **This should be all original work by the contributors of the project.**
* The `external` folder includes:
  * Submodules of other, more general projects that Lost Forever uses.
  * Individual script files from the Denizen Forum.
* External scripts may or may not include contributor work. However, non-contributor work must abide by the project's license.

### Style Guide

* Prefix script names with `lf`.
* Flags should fall under sub-flags of `lf`.
  * Example: `- flag <player> lf.thing:...`
* Use comments effectively to outline the more complicated details of a script.
  * README files should also be considered if the setup requires more extensive documentation.
